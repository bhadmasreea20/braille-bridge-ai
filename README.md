# Braille Bridge

**Braille Bridge** is an AI-powered mobile app designed to improve accessibility and inclusion for the visually impaired. It has a dual purpose:

1. **For visually impaired users who do not know Braille:**  
   - Scan physical Braille text using a phone camera  
   - Translate Braille dots into readable text  
   - Hear the translation through audio (Text-to-Speech)  

2. **For family, friends, or caregivers:**  
   - Learn Braille interactively  
   - Understand Braille dot patterns  
   - Help visually impaired individuals communicate and navigate the world
