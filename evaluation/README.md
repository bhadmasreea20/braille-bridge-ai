## 📊 Evaluation Dataset & Results

### Evaluation Dataset
The evaluation dataset consisted of sample Braille inputs used to test the AI system, including:
- Printed English Braille characters and short words
- Standard Braille dot patterns
- Images captured under different lighting conditions
- Publicly available Braille reference images for testing

### Evaluation Methodology
Each Braille image was provided as input to the AI pipeline built using Airia and the Gemini 2.0 Flash model.
The system was evaluated based on:
- Accuracy of Braille character recognition
- Correctness of translated text
- Clarity of audio output
- Response time and usability

### Results
- High accuracy for clear and well-lit Braille images
- Fast response time due to Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Clear and understandable audio output
- Slight performance reduction in low-light or unclear images

### Limitations & Future Improvements
- Sensitivity to image quality and lighting conditions
- Limited dataset size and English-only support
- Planned improvements include real-time processing and multi-language support
